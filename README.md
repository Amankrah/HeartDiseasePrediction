## README.md for Heart Disease Prediction Notebook

### Overview

This notebook aims to predict heart disease using machine learning algorithms. It takes you through the entire machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

### Table of Contents

1. [Importing the Dependencies](#importing-the-dependencies)
2. [Data Collection and Processing](#data-collection-and-processing)
3. [Explanation of Target Labels](#explanation-of-target-labels)
4. [Splitting the Features and Target](#splitting-the-features-and-target)
5. [Splitting the Data into Training and Test Data](#splitting-the-data-into-training-and-test-data)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib (for data visualization)

### Usage

1. **Importing the Dependencies**: The notebook begins by importing the necessary Python libraries used for data processing and machine learning.

2. **Data Collection and Processing**: Data relevant to the prediction of heart disease is collected and processed.

3. **Explanation of Target Labels**: The notebook explains the target labels, where '1' indicates a defective heart and '0' indicates a healthy heart.

4. **Splitting the Features and Target**: The data is separated into features and target labels to facilitate the training of the machine learning model.

5. **Splitting the Data into Training and Test Data**: The data is further split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Project_10_Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Run the notebook cells in sequence to go through the machine learning pipeline.
